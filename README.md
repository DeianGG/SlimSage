## Description

&nbsp;Full stack website made using HTML, CSS, JAVASCRIPT, PHP and SQL. It is a simple website where normal users can post/view recipes and suggest/view physical exercises which then can be either approved or declined by the administrator. The administrator can post/view receipes and approve/decline/post physical exercises.
When you suggest/post a physical exercise you have to write the title of the exercise, a short description of the exercise and link a video with that exercise so it is easier to understand by other users. If you want to post a recipe you have to write a title, a description and to provide a representative image for your dish.
